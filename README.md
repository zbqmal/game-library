## Development Roadmap

This project is being built incrementally in small PRs:

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Project setup and basic structure
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Homepage with game grid and search
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Individual game implementations (Up And Down, Rock-Paper-Scissors)
- ✅ **Phase 3.1**: UI fixes and refinements
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Stairs game implementation
- 📋 **Phase 5**: Backend API setup
- 📋 **Phase 6**: Database integration
- 📋 **Phase 7**: Additional games

### Phase 2: Homepage with Game Grid and Search

**Goal**: Implement a functional homepage that displays a grid of available games with client-side search capabilities.

**Deliverables**:
- Game metadata source with initial game entries (Number Guessing, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Stairs)
- Responsive game grid with thumbnail cards
- Client-side fuzzy search using Fuse.js
- Accessible, keyboard-navigable UI components
- Unit tests for core components
- E2E test setup with basic smoke tests

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Homepage displays a responsive grid of game cards with thumbnails and titles
- ✅ Search bar filters games in real-time with debouncing (200ms)
- ✅ Game tiles are keyboard-accessible and clickable
- ✅ Images lazy-load and have proper alt text
- ✅ Scoreboard badge displays on games that support high scores
- ✅ Unit tests pass for SearchBar and GameGrid components
- ✅ E2E test verifies search filtering and navigation

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add game metadata module (`app/data/games.ts`)
2. Create reusable components:
   - `GameTile.tsx` - Individual game card
   - `GameGrid.tsx` - Responsive grid container
   - `SearchBar.tsx` - Debounced search input
3. Update homepage to integrate components
4. Add placeholder images for games
5. Implement unit tests using Vitest + React Testing Library
6. Add E2E test with Playwright (or manual verification steps)

**Recommended Technical Choices**:
- **Search**: Fuse.js for fuzzy client-side search (with substring fallback)
- **Metadata**: Local TypeScript module (no backend yet)
- **Images**: WebP placeholders in `public/images/games/`
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E

**Branch Naming**: `feature/homepage-grid-search`

**PR Checklist**:
- [ ] All components are TypeScript with proper types
- [ ] Accessibility: Focus outlines, alt text, keyboard navigation
- [ ] Images use lazy loading
- [ ] Search is debounced (200ms)
- [ ] Unit tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] E2E tests pass or manual verification documented
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] README updated with Phase 2 details

**Notes for Future Work**:
- Phase 3 will implement actual game pages at routes specified in metadata
- Backend integration (Phase 4) will replace local metadata with API calls
- Scoreboard functionality will be added in Phase 4-5

### Phase 3: Individual Game Implementations

**Goal**: Implement Up And Down and Rock-Paper-Scissors games with frontend-only scoreboards using localStorage.

**Deliverables**:
- Up And Down game with configurable range and attempts
- Rock-Paper-Scissors game with countdown animation and consecutive win tracking
- Shared components: GameShell, Scoreboard, NameInputModal, Countdown
- Scoreboard adapter with localStorage persistence (adapter pattern for easy backend migration)
- Comprehensive Jest tests for game logic and components
- Migration from Vitest to Jest (user preference)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Up And Down page is functional with UP/DOWN/CONGRATS messages and retry
- ✅ RPS page tracks consecutive wins and persists Top-10 scores to localStorage
- ✅ Scoreboard displays Top-10 scores from localStorage
- ✅ All Jest tests pass with good coverage
- ✅ Code passes linting and TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Games are playable and match specifications

**Testing**:
```bash
# Run all Jest tests
npm test

# Run Jest in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

**Playing the Games**:
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Click on "Up And Down" or "Rock-Paper-Scissors" tiles
4. Play the games and check scoreboards (RPS only)

**Branch**: `feature/games-phase3`

**Notes**:
- Scoreboard uses localStorage via an adapter pattern for easy backend migration
- Jest replaced Vitest per user preference

### Phase 4: Stairs Game Implementation

**Goal**: Port the STAIRS game from the original GBA implementation into the Game Library.

**Deliverables**:
- TypeScript port of STAIRS game logic (WASM compilation not feasible for GBA-specific C code)
- Dice rolling mechanics with visual feedback
- Stair progression and visualization
- Mini-game integration (RPS initially, with placeholders for others)
- Score calculation following original rules:
  - If player loses first mini-game: final score = 0
  - If player wins: record stair count as score
  - Player can continue playing after winning
- Scoreboard integration with localStorage
- Comprehensive Jest unit tests (29 tests, 100% coverage on game logic)
- E2E test with Playwright

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ STAIRS game page is functional and follows original game behavior
- ✅ Dice rolling works correctly (1-6 values)
- ✅ Player climbs stairs based on dice roll
- ✅ "GAME START" button appears when reaching top (5+ stairs)
- ✅ Random mini-game launches (4 types: RPS, Treasure Hunt, Paroma, Swimming Race)
- ✅ Score rules are correctly implemented (0 on first loss, else highest stair count)
- ✅ Player can continue playing after winning a mini-game
- ✅ Scoreboard displays Top-10 scores and allows name entry
- ✅ All tests pass (85 total including 29 new STAIRS tests)
- ✅ Code passes linting
- ✅ Visual stairs display shows progress
- ✅ Responsive design works on all screen sizes

**Branch**: `feature/games-stairs`

**Notes**:
- Original STAIRS game: https://github.com/zbqmal/STAIRS (GBA game written in C)
- WASM compilation was evaluated but not feasible due to GBA hardware dependencies
- TypeScript port maintains original game rules and behavior
- RPS mini-game is fully functional; others have demo buttons for testing
- Future work: Implement remaining mini-games (Treasure Hunt, Paroma, Swimming Race)

## Games

### Available Games

1. **Up And Down** - Guess the secret number with limited attempts
2. **Rock-Paper-Scissors** - Play against the computer for consecutive wins
3. **Stairs** - Roll dice, climb stairs, and win mini-games for high scores
